CSS Grid turns HTML element into a grid container with rows and columns for you to place children elements
where you want within the grid

@Create CSS grid
- turn any HTML element into a grid container by setting 'display' property to grid
'display: grid;'

- in CSS grid, parent element is called the 'container' and its children are called 'items'

<style>
  .d1{background:LightSkyBlue;}
  .d2{background:LightSalmon;}
  .d3{background:PaleTurquoise;}
  .d4{background:LightPink;}
  .d5{background:PaleGreen;}

  .container {
    font-size: 40px;
    width: 100%;
    background: LightGray;
    /* Only change code below this line */
    display: grid;
    
    /* Only change code above this line */
  }
</style>

<div class="container">
  <div class="d1">1</div>
  <div class="d2">2</div>
  <div class="d3">3</div>
  <div class="d4">4</div>
  <div class="d5">5</div>
</div>

in this example, we create a div with the class="container", which has it's display set to grid
all items within this div are it's children and can be manipulated with grid properties

@Add columns and rows to grid
- to add columns use
'grid-template-columns: 50px 50px ...'
    - number of inputs indicate number of columns and value of input indicates width of each column

- to add rows use
'grid-template-rows: 50px 50px ...'

@Use CSS grid units to change size of columns and rows
- can use absolute and relative units to define size of columns and rows
    - 'px' and 'em'
    - 'fr': sets column/row to a fraction of the available space
    - 'auto' sets column/row to width or height of its content automatically
    - '%' adjusts column/row to the % width of its container (parent)

@Create a column gap using grid-column-gap
- creates gap between the columns
'grid-column-gap: 10px'

@Create a row gap using grid-row-gap
- creates gaps for the rows
'grid-row-gap: 10px'

@Add gaps faster with 'grid-gap'
- combination of grid-column-gap and grid-row-gap
- if only given one value then will set both column and row to that width
- else give 2 inputs to first change row gap and then change column gap

@Use grid-column or grid-row to control spacing
- all properties above control the grid containers and not the grid items
'grid-column: a / b;' controls how many columns an grid item consumes from line a to line b (horizontal)
'grid-row: x / y;' controls how many rows a grid item consumes from line x to line y (vertical)

@Align an item horizontally using 'justify-self'
- content of each item is located in a box which is called a 'cell'
- can align content's position within its cell horizontally using 'justify-self' property on the grid item
- default value set to 'stretch' which takes entire width of the cell
'justify-self: stretch;'
    - other values include
        - 'start' aligns to left
        - 'end' aligns to right
        - 'center' aligns to middle

@Align an item vertically using align-self
- same as above but aligns things vertically
'align-self: stretch;'
- also takes other values as well

@Align all items horizontally using justify-items
'justify-items: value;'
- play this property in the comtainer class to apply input to all grid items

@Align all items vertically suing align-items;
'align-items: vallue;'
- play this property in the comtainer class to apply input to all grid items

@Divide a grid into an area template
- can group cells of your grind together into an area and give the area a custom name
- set 'grid-template-areas' property in container class to set names to each cell

e.g. for a 3x3 column cell container

grid-template-areas:
  "header header header"
  "advert content content"
  "footer footer footer";

merges top 3 cells together into an area named 'header', middle 3 to 'advert' and 'content',
and bottom to 'footer'

Note: Every word in the code represents a cell and every pair of quotation marks represent a row. In addition to custom labels, you can use a period (.) to designate an empty cell in the grid.

@Place items in grid areas using the 'grid-area' property
- within grid items by using 'grid-area' property can reference where you want to put items within container

@Use 'grid-area' without creating an areas template
- if grid container doesn't have an areas template, can create one on the fly by creating it within grid item

e.g. item1 { grid-area: 1/1/2/4; }

where input 1 and 2 are where area starts from and 3 and 4 are where area ends
    - think 2 points covering an area
    - grid-area: horizontal line to start at / vertical line to start at / horizontal line to end at / vertical line to end at;

@Reduce repetition using the 'repeat' function
- what if you wanted to created 100 columns and 100 rows? would you have to type 'grid-template-columns: 100px 100px ... 100px' 100 times?
- ANSWER IS NO BY USING 'repeat' FUNCTION
e.g. 
'grid-template-rows: repeat(100, 50px)' will creat 100 row grids of 50 px

- You can also repeat multiple values with the repeat function and insert the function amongst other values when defining a grid structure. Here's what that looks like:

grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr 50px) 20px;

This translates to:

grid-template-columns: 1fr 50px 1fr 50px 20px;

Note: The 1fr 50px is repeated twice followed by 20px.

@Limit item size using 'minmax()' function
- minmax is used to limit size of items when the grid container changes size
e.g

grid-template-columns: 100px minmax(50px, 200px);
In the code above, grid-template-columns is set to create two columns; the first is 100px wide, and the second has the minimum width of 50px and the maximum width of 200px.

@Create flexible layouts using auto-fill
'repeat' function comes with an option called 'auto-fill'
- automatically inserts as many rows/columns depending on size of container
- can create flexible layouts when combing auto-fill with minmax
e.g

repeat(auto-fill, minmax(60px, 1fr));

When container changes size, keeps inserting 60px columns and stretching them until it can insert another one

@Create flexible layouts using auto-fit
auto-fit is almost like auto-fill
- only diff is when container size exceeds the size of all items combined, auto-fill keeps inserting empty row/columns and pushes items to the side
- while auto-fit collapses those empty rows and STRETCHES your items to fit the size of the container
