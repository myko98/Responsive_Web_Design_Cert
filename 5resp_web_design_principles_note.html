Responsive web design is an approach to designing web content that responds to sizing of different devices
If you expect most will be viewing from mobile, take a mobile first approach and add rules for larger screens

@Create a media query
- @media query changes the presentation of content based on different viewport sizes

e.g media query that returns content when device's width is less than or equal to 100px
@media (max-width: 100px) { /* CSS Rules */ }

@Make an image responsive
- 'max-width' property will make sure image is never wider than the container its in
- 'height' property of auto will make the image keep its original aspect ratio

<style>
.responsive-img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;

}

img {
  width: 600px;
}
</style>

@Use a retina image for higher resolution displays
- Pixel density is an aspect that could be different on one device from another and this density
- is known as pixel per inch (PPI) or dots per inch (DPI)
e.g mac book pros have retina displays. due to diff in pixel density between retina and non-retina
some images that have not been made with high rez in mind will look pixilated on retina models
- simplest way to make images appear proper on high rez displays is to define 'width' and 'height' property values as
- only half of what the original file is

@Make typography responsive
- instead of using em/px to size text, can use viewport units for responsive typography
- like %, viewport units are relative units, but relative to 'viewport dimensions' of a device
- whereas % are relative to size of the parent container element

- 4 different viewport units are:
    1. Viewport width '10vw' would be 10% of viewports width
    2. vh (viewport height): 3vh would be 3% of the viewport's height.
    3. vmin (viewport minimum): 70vmin would be 70% of the viewport's smaller dimension (height or width).
    4. vmax (viewport maximum): 100vmax would be 100% of the viewport's bigger dimension (height or width).
