<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--
- some users rely on assistive tech such as screen reader/voice recognition
- some use keyboard to navigate through site
- important to create web pages that are accessible to a variety of users

3 general concepts
    1. have well organized code that uses appropriate mark up
    2. ensure text alternatives exist for non-text and visual content
    3. create easily navigated page thats keyboard friendly

@add a text alternative to image for visually imparied
<img src="image" alt="image description">
- if <img> element is enclosed by another element that describes the image, then set alt=""

@Use headings to show hierarachical relationships of content
- its important for heading tags (h1 - h6) to have semantic meaning and relate to each other, not merely for their size values
- def semantic: tag you use around content indicates the type of information it contains
- e.g. if you use h2 tag which then has subheadings, it is better to use h3 tags instead of h4 tags
- you can then adjust h3 tags to fit proper sizing you want
- each page should have only one h1 element (main subject of your content)
- heading elements are used in part by search engines to understand topic of page

@Jump straight to the content using the main element
- html5 introduces new elements that help with accessibility features: 'main','header','footer','nav','article','selection'
- renders visually like div element
- using them appropriate gives additional meaning to markup
- tag name alone can indicate type of info it contains -> adds semantic meaning to content
    - assesstive tech can access this info to provide better page summary or nav options

'main' element is used to wrap main content
- should only be one per page
- should surround info thats related to central topic of page

@wrap content in 'article' element
- 'article' is a sectioning element, used to wrap independent, self-contained content
- good for blog entries, forum posts, news articles

    Note about <selection> and <div>
        - article is for standalone content
        - selection is for grouping thematically related content
        - can be used within each other as needed
        - think a book as article and each chapter is a selection
        - when theres no relationship between groups of content, use div

@Make screen reader navigation easier with <header> landmark
- 'header' tag used to wrap intro info or nav links for its parent tag
- has landmark feature like <main>, allowing assistive tec to quickly navigate to that content
- header is meant for use in the body tag, and is diff from <head> element found before the body tag
- header != head !!!

@nav landmark
- contains landmark feature that helps screen reader navigation
- 'nav' element used to wrap around main navigation links to your page

@footer landmark
- contains landmark feature that helps screen reader navigation
- used to contain copyright info or links related to doc at THE BOTTOM OF A PAGE

@Improve accessibility of audio content with <audio> element
- creates audio play bar

e.g

<audio id="meowClip" controls>
  <source src="audio/meow.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
</audio>

@add accessible date picker
- can be done by setting type="date" for <input> element
- <input type="date" id="pickdate" name="date">
