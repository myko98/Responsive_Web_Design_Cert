@Intro to CSS flexbox
- UI has 2 components
    1. visual elements like color, fonts, images
    2. placement of elements

flexbox are used to create page layouts for a dynamic UI

@use 'display-flex' to position 2 boxes
- adding 'display: flex;' on an element allows you to use flex properties to build responsive page

@Use flex-direction property to make a row
- adding 'display: flex' to an element turns it into a 'flex container'
- makes it possible to align any children of that element into rows or column
    - can do this by adding 'flex-direction' property to that parent item and setting it to 'row' or 'column'
    - other options are 'row-reverse' and 'column-reverse'
    - default setting for 'flex-direction' is row

@Use flex-direction property to make a column
- creates column by vertically stacking children of a flex container
- 'flex-direction: column;'

@Align elements using 'justify-content' property
- common to want to tell CSS how to align and space out flex items in flex container
- 'justify-content' property allows us to do that
- the direction the flex items are arranged is called the 'main-axis'
    - e.g when flex-direction: row;, main-axis is horizontal (vertical when flex-direction: column)

    Options to space flex items
    1. justify-content: center;
    - alighsn all flex items to the center

    2. justify-content: flex-start;
    - aligns items to the start of the flex container
    - for row this means left, for columns this means top

    3. justify-content: flex-end
    - oppositie of flex-start

    4. justify-content: space-between
    - aligns first and last items to the ends of the container, with everything else evenlly spaced

    5. justify-content: space-around

    6. justify-content: space-evenly

@Align elements using align-items property
- 'align-items' property aligns flex items along the cross axis (opposite of main-axis)
    - if flex-direction: row, cross axis is vertical
    - if flex-direction: column, cross axis is horizontal

    different values include
        align-items: flex-start;
        align-items: flex-end;
        align-items: center;
        align-items: stretch;
        align-items: baseline;

@Use flex-wrap property to wrap a row or column
- by default, a flex container will fit all flex items together
- flex-wrap allows us to move extra items into a new row or column
- depends on the size of items and the size of the container

    1.flex-wrap: nowrap;
        - default

    2.flex-wrap: wrap;
        - wrap items from L to R (if flex-direction: row) or T to B (if flex-direction: column)

    3.flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;
        - wrap items from R to L (if flex-direction: row) or B to T (if flex-direction: column)

@Use the flex-shrink property to shrink items
- several useful properties for flex items (within flex container)
- 'flex-shrink' property allows an item to shrink if flex container is too small
    - items shrink when the width of the parent container is smaller than the combined width of all the flex items within it
    - flex-shrink takes numbers as values, higher the number, more it will shrink compared to other items in container
    e.g. flex-shrink: 1 vs flex-shrink: 3 -> 3 will shrink 3x as much as 1

@'flex-grow' property
- opposite of flex-shrink property

@'flex-basis' property
- specifies intial size of item before CSS makes adjustments with flex-shrink, flex-grow
- units used by flex-basis are (px, em, %, etc)
- value 'auto' sizes items on the content

@flex shortcut
- 'flex' property allows us to set flew-grow, flew-shrink, flex-basis on one line
e.g. flex: 1 0 10px will set
    - flex-grow: 1;
    - flex-shrink: 0;
    - flex-basis: 10px;
- default is flex: 0 1 auto;

@'order' property
- setting order property to rearrange items
- takes integer values (includes negatives)
- higher value goes after lower

@'align-self' property ???
- allows you to adjust each item's alignment individually
